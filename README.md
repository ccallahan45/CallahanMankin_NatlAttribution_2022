# CallahanMankin_NatlAttribution_2022

This repository provides replication data and code for the paper "National attribution of historical climate damages," by Christopher W. Callahan and Justin S. Mankin, published in _Climatic Change_ (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-022-03387-y).

The repository is organized into **Scripts/**, **Figures/**, and **Data/** folders.

- **Scripts/**: All code required to reproduce the findings of our work is included in this folder. Most of the code is provided in Jupyter notebooks, except for major scripts like *Calculate\_Damages.py*, which requires batch processing on a high-performance computing cluster.

- **Figures/**: The final figures, both in the main text and the supplement, are included in this folder.

- **Data/**: This folder includes processed summary data that enable replication of all the figures and numbers cited in the text. The full data associated with the project amount to 7TB in total, and so we do not provide this data in full. Should you desire any of this underlying data, feel free to contact me at _Christopher.W.Callahan.GR (at) dartmouth (dot) edu_ and I will happily work to organize a mass data transfer.
