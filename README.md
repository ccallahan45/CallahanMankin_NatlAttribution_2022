# CallahanMankin_NatlAttribution_2022

This repository provides replication data and code for the paper "National attribution of historical climate damages," by Christopher W. Callahan and Justin S. Mankin, published in _Climatic Change_ (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-022-03387-y).

### Overview

The repository is organized into **Scripts/**, **Figures/**, and **Data/** folders. All code required to reproduce the findings of our work is included in the **Scripts/** folder. Most of the code is provided in Jupyter notebooks, except for major scripts like *Calculate\_Damages.py*, which requires batch processing on a high-performance computing cluster.

The final figures, both in the main text and the supplement, are included in the **Figures/** folder.

The data associated with the project comes to some 7TB in total, and so we do not provide all the raw data.
